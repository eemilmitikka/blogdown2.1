I'm a quantitatively oriented Ph.D. Candidate and social scientist from Helsinki. Currently, I work as a doctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki [(Doctoral Programme in Political, Societal and Regional Change)](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/admissions-and-education/apply-doctoral-programmes/doctoral-schools-and-doctoral-programmes/doctoral-school-humanities-and-social-sciences/doctoral-programme-political-societal-and-regional-change). My Ph.D. research deals with how political participation relates to authoritarianism in Russia and post-Soviet area.
