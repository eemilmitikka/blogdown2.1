I am a PhD candidate specializing in Russia and post-Soviet countries. I received my Bachelor of Social Science and my Master of Social Science in social and public policy from the University of Helsinki. Additionally, I have received Expertise in Russian and Eastern European Studies [(ExpREES)](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/aleksanteri-institute/education/master-level/exprees) from Aleksanteri Institute/the University of Helsinki. Currently, I work as a doctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki/[Aleksanteri Institute](https://www2.helsinki.fi/en/aleksanteri-institute). My PhD research deals with how political participation relates to authoritarianism in Russia and more generally in the post-Soviet area. Besides my background in social sciences and humanities, I am a quantitatively oriented researcher and an enthusiastic R user. I am also interested in promoting reproducible research and open data.
