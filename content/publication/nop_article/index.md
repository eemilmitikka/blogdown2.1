abstract: Since the early 2000s, the Kremlin has sought to make  patriotism an  overarching  national  ideology  for  Russia.  In  recent  years,  the state-promoted patriotism has become increasingly militaristic  and  the  external  threats  have  been more  and  more  emphasized in the Kremlin’s discourse. At the same time, some streams of literature  suggest  that  the  majority  of  Russians  have  actually  embraced  the  state’s  vision  of  militaristic  patriotism  and  the  regime-promoted  idea  of  strong  political  leadership  over  democratic rule. Drawing on previous research and fresh and nationally representative survey data, we examine how public perceptions of patriotism relate to state-promoted patriotism and the preference for  political  authoritarian  leadership  in  contemporary  Russia.  Our results indicate that, while the Kremlin-promoted militaristic component of patriotism has slightly increased among the  Russian public  since  the  political  events  of  2014,  it  still  differs  from  the  state-imposed patriotism in many ways and remains more diverse across  Russian society.  Furthermore,  the  notion  of  patriotism  in  mass opinion has remained by and large the same despite the ‘rallying around the flag’ after the annexation of Crimea in 2014.
