<p>In this blog post, I will show how to create a structural equation model (henceforth: SEM) plot from the scratch using <strong>semPlot</strong> package’s <code>semPlotModel()</code> function. Drawing SEM models with this function might be obvious to some of you, but I discovered this function myself only recently from Boris Sokolov’s <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/index-of-emancipative-values-measurement-model-misspecifications/5786A8463FCE705D22E54082DFFB209E#article"><em>The Index of Emancipative Values: Measurement Model Misspecifications</em></a> (see short description of Emancipative Values index in the end of this post)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> article’s <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/TPGPCR/TSVAA3&amp;version=1.1">replication code</a>, and thought that sharing this information might be useful to others.</p>
<p>Here is how Sokolov <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-sokolov2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> created the path model describing Emancipative Values Index (NB: code is directly copied from Sokolov’s <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/TPGPCR/TSVAA3&amp;version=1.1">replication code</a>, only <code>tiff()</code> function is commented out in here):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(semPlot)
# define a CFA measurement model for the EVI
EVI &lt;- &#39;Autonomy  =~ Independence + Imagination + Obedience 
              Equality =~ Jobs + Leaders + Education
              Choice  =~ Homosexuality + Abortion + Divorce 
              Voice =~ Speech + Say_nat + Say_local 
              EVI =~ Autonomy + Equality + Choice + Voice&#39;

# plot the measurement model

# tiff(&#39;Figure 1.tiff&#39;, units = &quot;cm&quot;, width = 15.5, height = 9, res = 1000)

semPaths(semPlotModel(EVI), curvePivot = TRUE,
residuals = FALSE,
nodeLabels= c(&quot;Inde-\npendence&quot;, &quot;Imagi-\nnation&quot;, &quot;Obedience&quot;, # set node labels
&quot;Jobs&quot;, &quot;Leaders&quot;, &quot;Education&quot;,
&quot;Homo-\nsexuality&quot;, &quot;Abortion&quot;, &quot;Divorce&quot;,
&quot;Freedom \nof speech&quot;, &quot;More Say:\n National&quot;, &quot;More Say:\n Local&quot;, 
&quot;Autonomy&quot;, &quot;Equality&quot;, &quot;Choice&quot;, &quot;Voice&quot;, &quot;Index of\nEmancipative\nValues&quot; ),
optimizeLatRes = TRUE,
sizeMan = 9,
sizeMan2 = 5,
sizeLat = 12,
mar = c(5,1,7,1),
label.cex= 0.6, 
label.scale= FALSE, # label size is not matched to the size of node
edge.width= 1.5,  
edge.color= &quot;black&quot;)  # color of edge lines</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>So, the only input needed to create a SEM plot from scratch is the hypothesized measurement model, which is here the <strong>EVI</strong> object. Then you just pass this measurement model as an argument to <code>semPlotModel()</code> function and define rest of the attributes within the <code>semPaths()</code> function call. Note that since the wording of your own model’s latent variables (text within the circles, here: “Index of Emancipative Values,” “Autonomy,” “Equality,” “Choice” and “Voice”) and manifest variables (here: “Indepence,” “Imagination,” “Obedience,” “Jobs,” “Leaders,” “Education,” “Homosexuality,” “Abortion,” “Divorce,” “Freedom of speech,” “More Say: National” and “More Say: Local”) differs probably from the wording of the EVI model described above, you probably have to adjust the size of your latent and manifest variables, resize the label, etc. You may just type <code>?semPaths</code> in your RMarkdown document’s code chunk section to see the details of the <code>semPaths()</code> function’s arguments:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>?semPaths</code></pre>

<h2>Own SEM model from scratch and further modifications of the plot</h2>
<p>To further illustrate the possibilities for creating your own SEM model from scratch, let us next create a SEM model of political participation described by Marc Hooghe and Sofie Marien <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-hooghe2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>. In their article (ibid.), Hooghe and Marien define political participation as a three-dimensional phenomenon, which consists of:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Insitutionalized participation</li>
<li>Non-institutionalized participation</li>
<li>Voting</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us first define the hypothesized model. In the code chunk below, I have named this hypothesized model as <code>participation_hooghe_marien</code>, but you may give it almost any name you want.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In the code below, I have also used <strong><code>"tree3"</code></strong> layout and <strong><code>rotation = 2</code></strong> options to give a bit more air between the latent variables and to draw the plot horizontally instead of vertical presentation. I also changed the edge color to gray draw the lines between the variables in grey color instead of black just to illustrate some modification possibilities.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(semPlot)
# Define your hypothesized model
participation_hooghe_marien &lt;- &#39;Institutionalized  =~ Contacting + Party + Organization 
              Noninstitutionalized =~ Demonstrating + Boycotting + Petitioning
              Voting  =~ National 
              Participation =~ Institutionalized + Noninstitutionalized + Voting&#39;

# Draw SEM path model
semPaths(semPlotModel(participation_hooghe_marien),
         rotation = 2, # this gives horizontal presentation of the plot
         layout = &quot;tree3&quot;,
         curvePivot = TRUE,
         residuals = FALSE,
         nodeLabels = c(&quot;Contacting&quot;, &quot;Party work&quot;, &quot;Organization\nwork&quot;,
                        &quot;Demon-\nstrating&quot;, &quot;Boycotting&quot;, &quot;Petitioning&quot;,
                        &quot;Voting in\nelections&quot;,
                        &quot;Institutionalized&quot;, &quot;Non-\ninstitutionalized&quot;, &quot;Voting&quot;,
                        &quot;Political\nparticipation&quot;),
         legend.cex = 0.4,
         optimizeLatRes = TRUE,
         sizeMan = 13, # width of the manifest nodes/variables
         sizeMan2 = 6, # height of the manifest nodes/variables
         sizeLat = 17, # width of the latent nodes/variables
         mar = c(1,4,1,4),
         label.cex = 0.8,
         label.scale = FALSE,
         edge.width = 1.5,
         edge.color = &quot;grey&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Let us define one more model from scratch. This time I will give shorter node names within the manifest variables (i.e. variables within the rectangles) and add longer question wordings in the side of the plot. This might be useful if you have lot of manifest variables and you struggle with their shorter naming (as I often do).</p>
<p>Since I am studying political participation, I will this time plot a model of political participation proposed by Bumsoo Kim and Jennifer Hoewe <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-kim2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. Kim and Hoewe suggest in their article that political participation has six distinctive dimensions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>traditional political participation,</li>
<li>interpersonal political talk,</li>
<li>voting,</li>
<li>social media engagement, and</li>
<li>online information seeking.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us plot this model with <code>semPlotModel()</code> fuction.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(semPlot)
# Define your model
participation_kim_hoewe &lt;- &quot;
InfoSeeking =~ Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4

SocialMedia =~ Q5 + Q6 + Q7 + Q8 + Q9 + Q10

Voting =~ Q11 + Q12

PoliticalTalk =~ Q13 + Q14 + Q15 + Q16
